#Magic Lamp

This is a simple project I'm working on for my girlfriend. A few years back I found a log at the beach. It was pretty solid so I kept it with no real purpose in mind. Eventually I decided to make it into a lamp, but not just any lamp; I wanted to make a lamp that could be controlled with a phone. Eventually I decided that I'd make it able to connect to WiFi and give it to my girlfriend so that I could send her messages in the form of blinking LED lights when I was away.
